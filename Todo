TODO list for Perl modules under Audio::M4P
    - We need a fuller suite of tests. Since this might require a real iTMS 
      file to be distributed with the app, this may need to wait a while.
    - an Encode.pm module, to create M4p from unencrypted .m4a content 
      (I have this partially working but cannot fully clone iTMS encoding yet)
